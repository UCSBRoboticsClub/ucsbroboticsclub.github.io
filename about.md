The Robotics Club @ UCSB is a student organization centered around building robots. We participate in several yearly competitions and engage in other projects throughout the year. Membership is free and open to all UCSB students. Our club advisor is [Prof. Byl](http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~katiebyl/).

We meet in Harold Frank Hall room 3120A. Weekly meetings are held on Fridays at 2 PM (correct as of 4/10/15), though we occasionally have extra meetings during the week, typically when preparing for a competition. We typically meet every Friday during Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters with the exception of finals week. Sign up for our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ucsb-robotics-club) to get up-to-date announcements through email. 

We use [Github](https://github.com/) to share code and other files for our robots. You can request an invite to join our [Github Organization](https://github.com/UCSBRoboticsClub/) at a meeting or by emailing one of the current club officers. You can see videos of our robots and other club activities at our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOe3xpXzI43P0LEzduwNDJg).

  - Gauthier Dieppedalle (President)
  - Patrick Clary (Internal VP)
  - Nickolas Clinton (External VP)
