This is the new website for the Robotics Club @ UCSB! This is where we will post details and updates about our projects, as well as announcements about club activities.

The website is hosted on Github Pages, which makes it easy for anyone in the club organization on Github to contribute to the website. Feel free to update or add pages for projects that you are working on.
