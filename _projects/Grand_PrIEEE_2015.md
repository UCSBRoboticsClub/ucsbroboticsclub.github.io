title: Grand PrIEEE 2015
---

The robotics club's 2015 entry for UCSD's [Grand PrIEEE](http://ieee.ucsd.edu/projects/gp/about) competition (formerly known as Viacar). The competition is modeled on UC Davis' Natcar competition. Car-like robots try to follow a track marked by tape and a wire carying a 75 kHz 100 ma RMS current and complete the course in the shortest time possible.

Body
====
Uses a lighter chassis than the 2014 robot. The new chassis is more suitable for running on carpet and is capable of sharper turns, which was a wearkness of the previous year's robot.

Sensors
=======
The sensors follow the same basic principles as the 2014 sensors, but have improved performance due to using specialized ICs for the instrumentation amplifier and demodulation/log conversion instead of general purpose opamps. The new sensors no longer need a negative voltage supply and have electromagnatic shielding to help lower the noise floor. The sensors could be improved in future years by adding more filtering for increased frequency selectivity.
